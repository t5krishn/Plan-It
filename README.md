# Plan-It
*(In progress)*

A collaborate trip planning app, allowing users to add events, to-do items, and split expenses within a trip.

It uses React Native alongside Redux on the front-end to deliver a true mobile experience and uses a Ruby on Rails backend API to interface with a PostgreSQL database.
